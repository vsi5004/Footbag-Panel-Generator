# Footbag Panel Generator
This is a single page website that enables users to generate panels for making freestyle footbags (hackysacks). The panels are configured, arranged and exported in an SVG file that can then be used to make tracing templates or be imported directly into a laser cutting software like LaserWeb.

This is very much an experimental piece of software so I make no guarantees about its functionality. If you find a bug and wish to help, feel free to make a fix and file a merge request.
